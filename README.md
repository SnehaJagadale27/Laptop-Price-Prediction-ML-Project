# Laptop-Price-Prediction-ML-Project
:  üìä Laptop Price Prediction ‚Äî   This project builds a supervised regression model to predict the laptop price based on its hardware and specification features. The system takes attributes like brand, screen size, CPU, RAM, storage type, GPU, operating system, weight, etc., as inputs, and outputs an estimated market price.

## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to estimate the selling price of a laptop based on its specifications. Given features like CPU, RAM, storage, brand, etc., the system predicts a reasonable market price. A user-facing web interface lets users input specs and see predicted prices.

---

## Problem Statement

- Many laptop listings are overpriced or undervalued relative to their specifications.  
- Buyers (and sellers) would benefit from a tool that gives an estimated "fair" price based on hardware specs.  
- The challenge is to model the (sometimes nonlinear) relationship between features and market price, while handling heterogeneity in data (different brands, CPU generations, memory types, etc.).

---

## Dataset

- Source: (e.g., Kaggle ‚ÄúLaptop Price Prediction‚Äù dataset) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Number of records: ~1,200‚Äì1,400 (depending on filtering)  
- Columns / features: brand, model, CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, screen size, screen resolution, weight, operating system, price (target)  
- Some data cleaning and preprocessing required (parsing strings, unit conversions, missing values, etc.)  

---

## Features (Input Variables)

Here are common features and transformations used:

| Feature | Description / Transformation |
|---|---|
| **Brand** | Laptop manufacturer (e.g., Dell, HP) |
| **Type / Form Factor** | Notebook, Ultrabook, Gaming, 2-in-1, etc. |
| **Screen Size (Inches)** | Numeric (e.g. 13.3, 15.6) |
| **Screen Resolution / Touchscreen** | Extract resolution (e.g. ‚Äú1920x1080‚Äù), flag touchscreen, compute PPI or resolution category |
| **CPU** | Extract brand/generation (e.g. Intel i5, i7, AMD Ryzen) and clock speed |
| **RAM (GB)** | Numeric after removing ‚ÄúGB‚Äù |
| **Storage** | Split into HDD / SSD / hybrid, extract capacity, sum multiples if two different storage types |
| **GPU / Graphics** | Discrete vs integrated GPU, GPU brand |
| **Weight (kg)** | Numeric after stripping ‚Äúkg‚Äù |
| **Operating System** | Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. |
| **Other flags** | e.g. ‚ÄúIs Touchscreen‚Äù, ‚ÄúHas HDD + SSD combo‚Äù, etc. |

## Solution Approach

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Clean raw data (remove units, fix typos, drop irrelevant columns)  
- Handle missing values (imputation or drop)  
- Encode categorical features (One-hot encoding, Label encoding, or ordinal mapping)  
- Scale / normalize numerical features if needed  
- Feature creation (e.g. combining memory types, deriving resolution features)  
- Correlation checks and feature selection  

### Modeling

Try multiple regression models, compare performance:

- Linear Regression (baseline)  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting (e.g. XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Possibly ensemble of models  

### Evaluation Metrics

- **R¬≤ (Coefficient of Determination)**  
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**  
- Possibly **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**  

### Hyperparameter Tuning & Validation

- Use cross-validation (e.g., K-fold CV)  
- Grid Search or Random Search for hyperparameters  
- Choose best model based on validation performance  
- Save best model + preprocessing pipeline (pickle / joblib)

---

## Web App / Deployment

- Framework: Flask or Streamlit (or FastAPI)  
- A simple frontend form where users input laptop specs  
- On submit, backend loads the saved model and pipeline, preprocesses input, predicts price, returns result  
- Optional: deploy on Heroku, Render, AWS, or similar  

---

## Usage

1. Launch web app (e.g. `python app.py` or `streamlit run app.py`)  
2. Open browser at `http://localhost:5000` (or port used)  
3. Enter laptop specifications  
4. Click ‚ÄúPredict‚Äù ‚Üí see estimated price  

---

## Results & Insights

- Present performance of different models (R¬≤, MAE, RMSE)  
- Feature importance (which features influence price most)  
- Visualizations: scatter plots of true vs predicted, residual plots, feature importance bar charts  
- Observations (e.g. ‚ÄúRAM and CPU strength were the most influential features‚Äù, etc.)

---

## Future Work / Improvements

- Use more data from current listings (web scraping)  
- Incorporate temporal trend (price drift over time)  
- Use more advanced models (neural networks, stacking)  
- Add model interpretability (SHAP, LIME)  
- Enhance UI/UX  
- Deploy as a REST API with proper error handling & scaling  
- Periodically retrain with new data
